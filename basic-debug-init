Slow Database Performance:
Identify problematic queries through database logs or profiling tools.
Analyze query execution plans for inefficiencies like missing indexes or suboptimal joins.
Optimize queries by adding indexes, rewriting queries, or restructuring the schema.
Monitor performance post-optimization.

High CPU Usage on Linux Server:
Use top or htop to find CPU-intensive processes.
Investigate with tools like strace, lsof, or perf.
Check system logs for errors.
Adjust configurations if needed.

Intermittent Network Connectivity Issues:
Check physical network infrastructure and configurations.
Use ping, traceroute, and netstat to diagnose.
Review firewall and routing configurations.
Analyze network traffic with tcpdump or Wireshark.
Implement solutions based on findings.

Service Failure After Update:
Check system logs for error messages.
Review service configuration files.
Verify dependencies and compatibility.
Research known issues and consult documentation.
Consider rolling back updates or implementing temporary fixes.

Intermittent Web Application Performance Degradation:
Monitor server resources during peak hours.
Analyze web server and application logs for patterns or errors.
Review database queries and application code for inefficiencies.
Scale up resources or optimize configurations.
Implement caching, load balancing, or other optimization techniques.
Continuously monitor and adjust for optimal performance.
